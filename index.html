        <h1>Sam Spott</h1>
        <h2>Hi, it's nice to meet you.</h2>
        <p>I am a high-spirited, dog-loving, outdoor enthusiast based out of Hood River, Oregon. As a UX Designer I believe that with every click, tap, or view within our digital world, it should bring you nothing but ease and contentment. This is why I focus on creating simple and enjoyable experiences designed specifically for our end users. </p>
        <p>My Baground started off in Denver, Colorado where I grew up admiring the creative world. Name any style of art or craft; and I figured out how to master it. That is how I learned that I can teach myself anything. After 5 years of exploring different fields of work, I found myself craving that creative lifestyle once again. Fast forward to now, and Iâ€™m overjoyed to be a part of the UI/UX world.  </p>
        <p>My skills include user research, empathy, qualitative interviewing, wireframing, prototyping, user testing, and collaborating.</p>

            <h3>Instant Vortex Plus</h3>
            <p>My Partner and I created a landing page for the Instant Vortex Plus Airfryer. Our goal was to create a sleek, modern, and bold design for a product that a person regularly uses in their day-to-day life. We both enjoyed collaborating on this prject together and getting the opportunity to create our own icons and graphics.

            <h3>The Pixie Project</h3>
            <p>For this non-profit website redesign my partner and I, both animal lovers, decided to choose a non-profit animal rescue shelter, The Pixie Project, located in Portland Oregon. We had the pleasure of meeting with the Director and getting a detailed understanding of how their animal adoption process works. We then redesigned their website to make it more interactive and user friendly.

            <h3>Obscure Travel App</h3>
            <p>For this project I worked both independently as well as with a partner for the first week. I was given the opportunity to design a travel planning app for travel junkies like myself. I wanted the app to feel like a social media app where users could socialize, share, save, and plan trips together.
